# Hudso's LIT-code

### What is this?
Problems, workflows, and solutions for various coding challenges on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), a site to help hone problem solving and coding skills. LeetCode offers an array (_pun intended_) of interesting problems to solve. I started working through these problems in August of 2021 for practice, not only for coding in a number of languages, but also for problem solving from an algorithmic perspective. 

### What's in the box?

In the main folder [problems](./problems), there is a folder named `[X]. <title>`, where `[X]` is the problem number of LeetCode, and `<title>` is... the title. Under each problem directory, you can find a `README.md` which describes the problem (basically, copy-pasta from LeetCode) and a link to try it out. 

`HINTS.md` contains hints to help solve the problem. If going into these problems yourself, I would recommend NOT reading hints until you absolutely need some direction. 

`SOLUTION.md` does not contain solution code itself; rather a step-by-step breaking down of the problem, and the _algorithm_ to solve it. I'm a big believer that understanding the underlying workflow and process is necessary before going and writing it in some programming language. 

That said, solution code will be under `solutions` in most popular languages, or at least the ones I can.

### Can I use any of this for reference/

Sure, as long as you don't count it as your stuff. Just drop a `courtesy of hudso` and you're good :)

...but, if you REALLY want to understand these problems, copy-pasta-ing the code isn't gonna help. My hope is that you'll work along with me, and learn along with me!

### Infrequently Asked Questions

> I think there's a problem with one of your solutions, it's not accepting my code

_probably not_, since I run everything through LeetCode in order to test my own solutions, but if there's something wrong, please let me know and I'd be happy to correct it.

> Can I contribute?

I would be extremely happy if people contributed! I would ask that you don't any content for problems not already solved on the repo. But if you have a different approach/solution that works, you can fork this repo and add it under the solution folder named something like `solution-<your name>` with the same hierarchy as my content. Shoot up a PR, I would love for this to not just be me.

> Your solution is garbage, I have a IQ of 180 and watched Rick and Morty Season 5 and let me tell you how my code...

It's perfectly alright if what I thought of isn't the _best_ solution in terms of runtime and memory (what LeetCode measures by). I would be extremely happy to see other solutions, worse or better, added or contributed to this repo. But don't be a dick.
